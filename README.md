# MagicBlock
This project is intended to be a heir of KNK system

KNK system is the abbreviation of Ki-Ng¯a-Kopuku system. It is designed as a decentralized distributed security system. This system is developed in Erlang, but
it is still under developing progress.

MagicBlock uses the idea of KNK, and hoping it will be the complete version of KNK.

Cheers, Yuzhu

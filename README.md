# MagicBlock
============

This project is intended to be a heir of KNK system

KNK system is the abbreviation of Ki-Ng¯a-Kopuku system. It is designed as a decentralized distributed security system. This system is developed in Erlang, but
it is still under developing progress.

MagicBlock uses the idea of KNK, and hoping it will be the complete version of KNK.

Cheers, Yuzhu

## Components

Components are a set of code blocks which are normally placed in one single file. Under MagicBlock project/system, 
each component should provide their own API and startup method. (should design **component design behaviours**, which requires each component
provide implementation method and APIs).
